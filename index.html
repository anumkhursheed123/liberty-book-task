            <p> Known for bringing a voice to the voiceless, Senator Kamala Harris is committed to speaking the truth.
                The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in a community that cared deeply about social justice and,
                growing up, Harris herself never hid her passion for doing what is right.</p>
            <p> Throughout her career, from starting out as a prosecutor right up to her position as California’s
                Attorney General, and now as a US Senator, her hallmarks have been applying a holistic, data-driven
                approach to the thorniest issues, whether it’s taking on the big banks or rejecting stale ‘tough on
                crime’ rhetoric as presenting a series of false choices. Neither ‘tough’ nor ‘soft’ but smart on crime
                became her mantra. Being smart means learning the truths that can make us better as a community, and
                supporting those truths with all our might. </p>
            <p> hrough the arc of her own life, Harris communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and
                shared values and grapples with complex issues that affect America and the world at large, from health
                care and the new economy to immigration, national security, the opioid crisis, and accelerating
                inequality. By reckoning with the big challenges we face together, drawing on the hard-won wisdom and
                insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, Kamala Harris offers in
                The Truths We Hold a master class in problem solving, in crisis management, and leadership in
                challenging times.</p>
